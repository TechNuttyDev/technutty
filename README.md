<h2>TechNutty Repo</h2>

<br>

<p>This is the GitHub repo for TechNutty, at the moment it doesn't contain much code, as a lot of it we don't want to make public, most of what we do want to make public will be released withijn seperate GitHub projects.</p>

<p>Instead we use this repo for tracking issues with the site, which we also have a Trello page for, you can find that here: https://trello.com/b/5CA1ARPO/technutty-projects </p>
